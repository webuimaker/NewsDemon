We would like to take this opportunity to say "hello" and welcome you to
NewsDemon. We're planning to use this blog to share our network status,
promotions, and related news with the Usenet community and our customers.  We
would value any feedback you might have for us.  Feel free to share
or [drop us a line](mailto:support@newsdemon.com).
